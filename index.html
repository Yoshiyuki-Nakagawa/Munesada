<ol>
<li><strong>Real life and work come first.</strong>  Play Whiteout Survival only when you have free time.</li>
<li><strong>Do NOT attack non-enemy alliances.</strong>  This includes NAP allies, friendly alliances, and alliances not in war with us.  If an event allows attacks, follow the event rules.  If you attack by mistake, talk to the Leader or R4 officers.</li>
<li><strong>World Chat:</strong>  Jokes are OK, but no insults, no racism, no harassment.  Your words represent our alliance.</li>
<li><strong>Respect everyone.</strong>  
All players are equal, no matter rank or alliance.  If there is a conflict, talk first. Ask the Leader or officers if needed.</li>

<li><strong>You can leave the alliance anytime.</strong>  If possible, please talk to the Leader or officers first.</li>
